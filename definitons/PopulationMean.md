**Population Mean Definition**

The population mean is an average of a group characteristic. The group could be a person, item, or thing, like “all the people living in the United States” or “all dog owners in Georgia”. A characteristic is just an item of interest.

In statistics, it’s actually rare that you can calculate the population mean. That’s because asking an entire population about something is usually cost prohibitive or too time consuming. For example, one veterinary practice probably keeps weight records of all the pets that come in the door, enabling you to calculate the average weight of a dog for that practice (i.e. the population mean for that practice). But if you were working for a pet food company who wanted to know the average weight of a dog, you wouldn’t be able to track down all the 70 to 80 million dogs in the US and weigh them. You would have to take a sample (a small portion of the population of dogs) and weigh them. You can then use this figure to approximate the population mean.

*Symbol*

The population mean symbol is μ.

*Formula*

The formula to find the population mean is:

μ = (Σ * X)/ N

where:

Σ means “the sum of.”

X = all the individual items in the group.

N = the number of items in the group.
