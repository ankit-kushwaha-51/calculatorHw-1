## **Confidence Interval**

The Confidence Interval is calculated by first calculating the sample mean.
Then, the sample standard deviation. Also, a Z-value is needed which is looked up
based on the percentage of confidence interval that is required. For example, the Z-value
for a 95% confidence interval is 1.960. Then, the Z-value is multiplied by the
sample standard deviation. This number is then divided by the square root of the
number of observations. Last, this number is added and subtracted from the sample
mean. The difference is the first number in the 95% confidence interval, and the
sum is the last number in the 95% confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval
would imply that for the population, a random value would have a 95% chance of
being in the 95% confidence interval.
