## **Sample Standard Deviation**

Sample standard deviation is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores on a given variable.
It is calculated by first getting the sample mean. Then, the sample mean is subtracted from each number, and each time it is squared.
Then, these are summed up. Next, they are divided by the value of "1" subtracted from the amount of scores in the sample. Finally, this number has its square root taken.
