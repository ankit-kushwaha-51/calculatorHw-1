## **Variance of Sample Proportion**

If we know that the count X of "successes" in a group of n observations with success probability p has a binomial distribution with mean np and variance np(1-p), then we are able to derive information about the distribution of the sample proportion, the count of successes X divided by the number of observations n. By the multiplicative properties of the mean, the mean of the distribution of X/n is equal to the mean of X divided by n, or np/n = p. This proves that the sample proportion  is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion p. The variance of X/n is equal to the variance of X divided by n², or (np(1-p))/n² = (p(1-p))/n . This formula indicates that as the size of the sample increases, the variance decreases. 
In the example of rolling a six-sided die 20 times, the probability p of rolling a six on any roll is 1/6, and the count X of sixes has a B(20, 1/6) distribution. The mean of this distribution is 20/6 = 3.33, and the variance is 20*1/6*5/6 = 100/36 = 2.78. The mean of the proportion of sixes in the 20 rolls, X/20, is equal to p = 1/6 = 0.167, and the variance of the proportion is equal to (1/6*5/6)/20 = 0.007.
