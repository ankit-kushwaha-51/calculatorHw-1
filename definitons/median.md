## **Median Value**

The Median is the "middle" of a sorted list of numbers.

**How to Find the Median Value**

To find the Median, place the numbers in value order and find the middle.

**Two Numbers in the Middle**

BUT, with an even amount of numbers things are slightly different.

In that case we find the middle pair of numbers, and then find the value that is half way between them. This is easily done by adding them together and dividing by two.
