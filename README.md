**Population Mean:**
Average score of the population.
Sum of all scores present in a population divided by total individuals in a population

**Median:**
When a set of values are arranged from lowest to highest, the median is in the middle of the list.
If there are an even amount of values, then the median is the average of the middle two numbers.

**Mode:**
Mode is the value or values in the data set that occur most frequently.

**Population Standard Deviation:**
The population standard deviation is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores on a given variable.
It is calculated by first getting the population mean. Then, population mean is subtracted from each number, and each time it is squared.
Then, these are summed up. Next, they are divided by the amount of scores in a population. Finally, this number has its square root taken.

**Variance of population proportion**:

To get “p”, just divide the total population  by the number of items you’re interested in . As a formula, it’s written as:

p= x/n

Where:
“x” is the number of items you’re interested in, and
“n” is the total number of items in the population.


**Z-Score:**
The Z score tells you how many standard deviations your value, assuming a
normal distribution, is away from the mean. The calculation occurs by taking
the mean of the sample, and subtracting it from the value. Then, this is divided
by the sample standard deviation.

**Standardized score:**
The Standardized score is the same as the Z score.


**Population Correlation Coefficient:**
The correlation ρ between two variables is:
ρ = [ 1 / N ] * Σ { [ (Xi - μX) / σx ] 
* [ (Yi - μY) / σy ] }
where N is the number of observations in the population, Σ is the summation symbol, Xi is the X value for observation i, μX is the population mean for variable X, Yi is the Y value for observation i, μY is the population mean for variable Y, σx is the population standard deviation of X, and σy is the population standard deviation of Y.


**Confidence Interval:**
The Confidence Interval is calculated by first calculating the sample mean.
Then, the sample standard deviation. Also, a Z-value is needed which is looked up
based on the percentage of confidence interval that is required. For example, the Z-value
for a 95% confidence interval is 1.960. Then, the Z-value is multiplied by the
sample standard deviation. This number is then divided by the square root of the
number of observations. Last, this number is added and subtracted from the sample
mean. The difference is the first number in the 95% confidence interval, and the
sum is the last number in the 95% confidence interval. A 95% confidence interval
would imply that for the population, a random value would have a 95% chance of
being in the 95% confidence interval.

**Population Variance:**
The variance of population proportion is found by first finding the mean of the population.
Then, the mean is subtracted from each value of the population. Then, each of these numbers is squared.
Then, all these numbers are summed up. Last, the value is divided by the number of scores in the population.

**P Value:**
P value is a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.
The smaller the P Value, the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis.

**Proportion:**
When 2 ratios are in proportion, it means that they are equal to the same value. This may be
even if the numerator and denominator of the ratio (or fraction) are different.

**Sample Mean:**
Sample mean is the average of a sample from the population. This is calculated by taking the sum
of the sample, and then dividing it by the number of population in the sample.

**Sample Standard Deviation:**
Sample standard deviation is a measure of the spread (variability) of the scores on a given variable.
It is calculated by first getting the sample mean. Then, the sample mean is subtracted from each number, and each time it is squared.
Then, these are summed up. Next, they are divided by the value of "1" subtracted from the amount of scores in the sample. Finally, this number has its square root taken.

**Variance of sample proportion:**
If we know that the count X of "successes" in a group of n observations with success probability p has a binomial distribution with mean np and variance np(1-p), then we are able to derive information about the distribution of the sample proportion, the count of successes X divided by the number of observations n. By the multiplicative properties of the mean, the mean of the distribution of X/n is equal to the mean of X divided by n, or np/n = p. This proves that the sample proportion  is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion p. The variance of X/n is equal to the variance of X divided by n², or (np(1-p))/n² = (p(1-p))/n . This formula indicates that as the size of the sample increases, the variance decreases. 
In the example of rolling a six-sided die 20 times, the probability p of rolling a six on any roll is 1/6, and the count X of sixes has a B(20, 1/6) distribution. The mean of this distribution is 20/6 = 3.33, and the variance is 20*1/6*5/6 = 100/36 = 2.78. The mean of the proportion of sixes in the 20 rolls, X/20, is equal to p = 1/6 = 0.167, and the variance of the proportion is equal to (1/6*5/6)/20 = 0.007.
